## SUDOKOU GRID GENERATOR

### Description
A Javascript program to generate a random 9X9 Sudoku grid.

I wrote a basic program which generates a 9X9 Sudoku grid. Not very efficient or consistent. But does its job fine. Basically tries to fill every place randomly, following the rules, untill it hits all roadblocks. Fills ~ slightly more than 1/3rd of all places(in 9X9, ~28-34). I checked some online Sudoku sites, which had almost the same number of filled elements. Output is printed on console.

### How to run
- In commandline shell execute `js sud_final.js`
