						SUDOKOU GRID GENERATOR


I wrote a basic program which generates a 9X9 Sudoku grid. Not very efficient or consistent. But does its job fine. Basically tries to fill every place randomly, following the rules, untill it hits all roadblocks. Fills ~ slightly more than 1/3rd of all places(in 9X9, ~28-34). I checked some online Sudoku sites, which had almost the same number of filled elements. Meanwhile, readability is poor and difficulty level is unknown :)
